																<h4>ABOUT JEFF’S ART & BOOKS</h4>
																
																<p>
																				Jeffers Joseph is an artist and an author. The art of Drawing always came naturally
which explains why Jeff has been drawing since childhood. Writing was another natural
talent and was further developed through the years which ultimately led to his first
published novel ‘Money, Misery & Murder’ (Murder and Mystery) in 2011. This was later
followed up by two other published books - ‘Friends with Deficits’(Romance and
Suspense); and ‘Democracy’s Hypocrisies’ (Politics).
																</p>
																
																<p>
																				Jeff is currently in the process of publishing two additional books:
																</p>
																
																<p>
																				‘Their Lives Mattered’ (Social Justice)—a book of art and commentary, in addition to an
informative and interactive book titled,
																</p>
																
																<p>
																				‘A Coloring Book of Black Inventors’. With an innate artistic talent, Jeffers has
developed into an accomplished artist in many areas of the industry. Much of his work is
on display on this website.
